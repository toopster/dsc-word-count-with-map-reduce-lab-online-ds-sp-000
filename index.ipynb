    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have seen the key map and reduce operators in Spark, and also know when to use transformation and action operators, we can revisit the word count problem we introduced earlier in the section. In this lab, we will read a text corpus into the Spark environment, perform a word count, and try basic NLP ideas to get a good grip on how MapReduce performs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply the map(func) transformation to a given function on all elements of an RDD in different partitions \n",
    "- Apply a map transformation for all elements of an RDD \n",
    "- Compare the difference between a transformation and an action within RDDs \n",
    "- Use collect(), count(), and take() actions to trigger spark transformations \n",
    "- Use filter to select data that meets certain specifications within an RDD \n",
    "- Use Spark and the MapReduce framework to complete a full parallelized word count problem \n",
    "\n",
    "## MapReduce task\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what our problem looks like:\n",

    "\n",
    "    * Analyze web server logs to find popular URLs\n",

We shall look at some texts by Shakespeare and Jane Austin following this motivation. \n",

    "In this simple exercise, we saw MapReduce in action for solving a basic NLP task, i.e. counting the frequency of stop words and keep words of a text corpus. This exercise can be seen as a first step towards text analytics on big data platforms. After this lab, we will get into more advanced use cases of PySpark, specifically for machine learning applications. "
